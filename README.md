# What I'm doing
- Conway's Game of Life: 2-d zero-player game
    - a cell is born if there are exactly 3 neighbouring alive cells
    - a cell remains alive if there are 2 or 3 neighbouring alive cells, otherwise the cell is dead
- use Raylib for graphics and input control

# GUI keybinds
- before simulation 
    - **LEFT MOUSE BUTTON (LMB)** to mark cells
    - **RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON (RMB)** to unmark the cells 
    - **C** to clear the cells
    - **ENTER** to start the simulation
- during simulation
    - **SPACEBAR** to pause the simulation
    - **SPACEBAR** <u>again</u> to continue the simulation
- after simulation  
    - **R** to reset the simulation
